/**
 * Centralised logo imports.
 * Vite processes these as module imports — it will bundle, hash, and correctly
 * resolve the URLs even when the app is served under a sub-path like
 * /development/m3infrastructure_frontend/.
 *
 * Use these named exports wherever a logo image is needed, instead of
 * hardcoded "/src/assets/..." strings which break in production.
